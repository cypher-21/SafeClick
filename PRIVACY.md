# SafeClick Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-08-25

SafeClick is designed to analyze websites locally in your browser to help you avoid phishing and unsafe sites. We take your privacy seriously.

## What data we access
- Page content needed for security analysis (DOM, forms, metadata)
- URLs and domains you navigate to (for trust scoring and redirect protection)
- Locally stored extension settings and history generated by the extension

## What we do NOT collect or transmit
- We do not collect, sell, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII)
- We do not transmit page contents, form data, passwords, or browsing history to our servers (there are none)
- All analysis is performed locally in your browser

## Recent changes (v1.0.3)
- Removed the "Why this score?" breakdown section from the popup UI.
- Stopped generating and sending breakdown data; only the final score, verdict, reasons, and essential details are shown.

## Permissions justification
- "activeTab", "tabs": Used to analyze the current page and display results
- "storage": Store local settings and security history on your device
- "scripting": Inject the content script that highlights risks on the current page
- "webRequest", "webNavigation", "declarativeNetRequest": Detect and control risky redirects and interstitial warnings
- "alarms": Periodic dataset refresh (e.g., phishing indicators)
- Host permissions (http/https): Required to analyze webpages you visit for phishing and credential risks
- https://data.phishtank.com/*: Used to download publicly available phishing data for on-device checks

## Data retention
- Site history is stored locally and can be exported or cleared by you at any time via the extension UI
- No data leaves your device

## Third parties
- No third-party analytics or tracking
- Public threat feeds may be downloaded directly by your browser to keep detections current

## Donations
Donations are optional and processed by third‑party providers (e.g., Buy Me a Coffee/PayPal/UPI). SafeClick does not collect payment information. See the provider’s privacy policy.
